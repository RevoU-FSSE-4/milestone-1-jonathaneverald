## Deployment Process

### Log in or Sign Up for a Netlify Account

- First, go to the Netlify website: https://www.netlify.com/.
- Click the Log in button if you already have an account, or Sign Up to create a new one.
- In this guide, we will log in using a GitHub account.

### Import Your Project

- Before importing your project, ake sure the domain currently linked to your previous project is disconnected. This will free up the domain for use with the project you want to import.
- Open the previous project that is currently linked to your domain.
- Go to the "domain management" menu and select "remove domain" for the domain associated with that project.

### Make Sure Your Project is Public

- Before selecting the project you want to connect, make sure it is set to public so it can be accessed.
- If it is still private, you can change the project settings in GitHub.

### Deploy Your Project

- Select the project you want to connect and click the Deploy (project name) button.
- Wait until the project finishes deploying through Netlify.

### Check Your Website

- Once the project has been successfully deployed, click the deployed website page to check your website.

### Connecting the Domain to Netlify:

- Open your Netlify project: Access your project on the Netlify platform. Click "Set up a custom domain" and enter the domain name you purchased.

  ![Set up Domain Netlify](./img/deploy-2.png)

- Enter the existing domain name, which is "jonathanportfolio.site".
- Once the domain name is entered, the domain will be connected to your project. Your project will then be accessible using that domain name.
- You do not need to wait for DNS configuration like before because the domain name has already been used in a previous project. Therefore, the domain already has DNS configuration that has been set by Netlify.
